    <h1>About Drowning In Dreams Studios</h1>
    <p>Drowning In Dreams Studios was founded by Lauren in May 2023. The name comes from just what it sounds like, having too many dreams and ideas, and not having anywhere to put them.</p>
    <p>Right now DIDS is solely run by Lauren and is acting as a place for her to post blogs, work in progress videos, stream games, gaining viewership and eventually (hopefully) to be used as a self-publishing video game company.  </p>
    <p>So, who is Lauren? After highschool, Lauren went to school for Computer Science but after two years, decided that computer science was not her calling and she swapped to a different school for Game Development. She graduated in 2021, and quickly after got her first job as a Junior Game Developer. As part of the flex team, she got involved in several different aspects of the team including quality assurance, human resources and more. After a couple years of gaining valuable work experience, she returned back to coding games on her own time.</p>
    <p>If you’re interested in seeing what Lauren is currently working on, check out the blog and be sure to follow us on Twitter, YouTube, and join the discord!</p>
